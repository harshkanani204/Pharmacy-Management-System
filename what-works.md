In Database,
- Everything is working all the triggers, functions, views, roles.

In django admin,
- All the trigger works, one can add, remove, and update data.
- Upon inserting in a relation having trigger trigger updates other tables.

What doesn't work,
- In exception case where we raise notice in postgressql in that case website gives error.
- Website not showing all the possible permissions (permissions on relations).
